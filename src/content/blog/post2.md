### Training

This was a part of my training block leading up to Stockholm Marathon 2024. I've been running consistently for the last 2-3 months averaging around 40-50k/week with a peak of 65k. I have not tapered before the race having had 44k in my legs coming in to the race. I had a modest goal of completing the race sub 1:45:00 if I felt like my body was not feeling good for the day. However, I knew that I had sub 1:40:00 in me.  

### Pre-race

I woke up at 2:30 in the morning having only slept for 1.5h. This was not optimal but it is what is. I am currently living and studying in Singapore, NTU, so it was almost 1 hour commute to the race. I jogged down to the Pioneer busstation to catch the bus. Due to traffic the bus arrived only 15 minutes before the race started and I only had time to eat one banana and no warm-up.

### Race

The race started and it was crowded! I was aiming going out in a pace of 4:45/km which I held for the first 6k. 7-13 I was struggling to keep up the pace mentally and ended up falling behind my goal pace. At 13k I found a person running in a good pace that I decided to follow and I felt much stronger with 7k to go. I ended the race putting in really good splits which felt really good.

### Post-race

My legs felt a bit sore but honestly was expecting worse. Felt like a really good indication for my marathon. I was really happy going sub 1:40:00 for my first HM making it a PB! :)
